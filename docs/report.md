# Space Rock Surprise: General report

This week's work introduced:

* a completely new ISA
* the concept of registers and memory as pertains the Raspberry Pico W device
* the concepts of registers and memory and basic manipulation of both.

Respond to the following prompts about the programs illustrating these concepts.

## Describe memory and registers. What are each? What are their similarities? Differences?

`TODO`

## Speculate: why is it not possible to operate on _memory_? Why do we need to use _registers_?

`TODO`

## Like CARDIAC, the ARMv6 ISA seems to require many instructions to satisfy basic programming goals. Why is this?

`TODO`

## Also similar to our experience with CARDIAC, there are concepts like `data words` and `instruction words`. Describe how _memory_ addresses fit into this concept.

`TODO`

## In our string-based examples, we cleared memory in two separate ways. However, we still had to clear memory for our final strings. Why was this?

> HINT: How does this figure into our conversation about the amount, type, and specificity of instructions in this (or any, for that matter) ISA?
